        <p>The Battle Cats is a free-to-play tower defense video game developed and published by Japanese developer PONOS Corporation for iOS and Android, originally released in Japan under the name Nyanko Great War (にゃんこ大戦争, Nyanko Dai Sensō). The Battle Cats debuted on the Japanese iOS App Store in November 2012 under the name Battle cats, with Android support following in December of that same year, and became popular in both Japan and Korea. It later was deleted from both the US Google Play stores and App Store, with an improved version released on 17 September 2014.[3] A Microsoft Windows port was released in August 2017, and was available for download until late 2018, when PONOS Corporation ended support for it. It was ported to the Nintendo 3DS in 2016 and Nintendo Switch in Japan in 2018 and Southeast Asia in 2021.</p>
